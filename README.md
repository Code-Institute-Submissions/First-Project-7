![Am I Responsive Picture](assets/images/AmIResponsive.jpg)

This site will be an ongoing static page, designed to present some general information about the metal band Sabaton.

It`s creation is for my first milestone project as a Full Stack software developer student of the Code Institute (https://codeinstitute.net/), 
with the goal of introducing the band to the user as in showcasing some of their latest music videos, providing some backstory and
history behind the creation of said music videos, showing off the newest band album and listing the upcoming live concerts.

## UX

 The purpose of the site is a simple introduction to my favourite rock band as well as providing some general information.

 #### User Stories

   * As a newcomer, I would like to sample some of the band`s latest hits.

   * As a person new to the band, I would like to familiraze more with the band ideology behind their songs as well as see some photos of live performances.

   * As an avid Sabaton fan, I would like to check upcoming live shows for the band.

   * As a fan, I would like to purchase their latest album, and check their contacts so that I can send some fan letters.

   * As a promoter, or a venue owner I would like to contact the apropriate people for booking a live show.

 ## Features

## Deployment

  1. Created a Github account at https://github.com
  My account url;    https://github.com/NihtianAtanasov

  2. I uploaded all files to my Github repository located at this url; https://github.com/NihtianAtanasov/First-Project which is for this individual project.

  3. To publish the project to see it on the web, I then went into the Settings on my respository, scrolled down to the heading, GitHub Pages. Under the Source setting, I used the drop-down menu to select master branch as a publishing source and saved it. Refreshed the github page, and you are then given a url where your page is published;
   Your site is published at https://nihtianatanasov.github.io/First-Project/

  4. To run this code on your local machine, you would go to my respository at 
https://github.com/NihtianAtanasov/First-Project and on the home page on the right hand side just above all the files, you will see a green button that says,
"Clone or download", this button will give you options to clone with HTTPS, open in desktop or download as a zip file.
To continue with cloning, you would;
  * Open Git Bash
  * Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  * Type git clone, and then paste this URL; https://github.com/NihtianAtanasov/First-Project  Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
